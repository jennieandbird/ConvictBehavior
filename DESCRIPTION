Description: The functions included in this package analyze data from experiments on social state and behavior in convict cichlids. One function performs an ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey HSD test, another checks for normality, a third graphs results as boxplots, and a fourth shows what the graph looks for different types of colorblind vision.
